# Extinction
Interactive Installation done in Processing

'Extinction' is an interactive short story created in Processing that utilizes engaging sounds and visuals to immerse users into an environment that changes and deteriorates based on the user’s intrusion. This project surged from the present narratives and worldwide anxieties regarding climate change and the irreversible effect humans have on the environment.

On the technical side, this piece tracks the user's position directly to the computer via a mouse or track pad or through a touchscreen, depending on the setup. 

This project has been showcased in Imagine Science Film Festival in Abu Dhabi, and will be exhibited in the "Interaction and Immersion" showcase of the Sehsüchte International Student Film Festival in Postdam, Germany.
